# Password Security Analysis Lab

## Overview
This project simulates an offline password cracking attack against weak password hashes to analyze common password vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- John the Ripper
- OpenSSL
- Linux (Ubuntu via WSL)

## Process
- Generated password hashes using OpenSSL
- Performed password cracking using John the Ripper
- Analyzed why weak passwords fail and how systems can defend against these attacks

## Key Findings
- Common passwords and predictable patterns are cracked quickly
- Weak hashing algorithms increase exposure during data breaches
- Strong password policies, salting, and multi factor authentication can reduce risk

## Ethical Disclaimer
All testing was conducted on locally generated password hashes for educational purposes only.
